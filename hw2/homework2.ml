  match lang with
  | [] -> "0"
  | hd :: tl -> letter^hd@prepend(letter, tl);;


let concatenate (alphabet, lang) = failwith "not implemented"


let all_strings (alphabet, n) = failwith "not implemented"



(* (* QUESTION 2 *)

let restrict (xs,n) = failwith "not implemented"


let langUnion (xs,ys,n) = failwith "not implemented"


let langConcat (xs,ys,n) = failwith "not implemented"


let langStar (xs,n) = failwith "not implemented"

(* (* QUESTION 3 *)
